            <p>Aspen,</p>
            <p>
	            I haven't met someone with features like yours. Your uniqueness and sweetness are truly captivating. When I asked to follow you, I never thought we would be as far apart as we are. To be sincere, I never hoped to talk to you - in my mind, you were beyond the understanding of my reality. Then, my consciousness was blown away when you approached me. Now, you are always on my mind. I think about how beautiful a life with you could be. Yet, I fear that if I were to lose you in an instant, I would lose all my hope in mankind.
